# salerno-scala

A repository of Scala programs that I have developed to hone my skills
	in functional programming.

Three primary goals of this endeavor are to:
+ develop (quasi-) automated techniques for
	compiler/parser development;
+ to develop an automated framework for statistical analysis/computation
	of experimental results; and
+ to develop faster prototypes for design automation, including
	microarchitecture synthesis, formal verification, and
	decision procedures (or automated reasoning).

# Scala Resources

*BibTeX* keys, from my *BibTeX* database, are used to identify
	publications that I can use to learn and revise *Scala*.
