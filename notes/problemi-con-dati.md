#	Problem: 3 GB per update

##	How do I keep the size of the updates manageable?

Update more frequently, 20-50 minutes. 

##	How do I "force" the updates to be <5 GB (or <8 GB)?

??? 



#	Problem: "make all", or "make torture", exceeds 1 hour

##	How do I run "make all", or "make torture", in <1 hour? 

Run more computations concurrently (or in parallel).

Use checkpointing in build automation.












#	Guidelines to avoid, or mitigate, problems

Push each "commit", and run regression tests for each modification.



Each day, run at least one "torture".

Each day should have at least one build.
