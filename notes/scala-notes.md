#	Key Features of *Scala*

##	In Comparison to *Java* 

\cite{Tate2010}

+ Type inference \cite[\S5.1, pp. 136]{Tate2010}
	- If possible, infer variable types.
		+ Local type inference has limitations due to its 
			not-so-good constraint solver \cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}.
	- *Java* requires type declaration for each variable,
		argument, or parameter.
	- Has strong support due to its type system
		\cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}.
+ Functional concepts \cite[\S5.1, pp. 137]{Tate2010}
	- Form new functions using existing functions in different ways,
		beyond simple "syntactical sugar" (or what Dr. Anders Franz{\'{e}}n
		calls, "syntactic sugar").
		+ Code blocks.
		+ Higher-order functions.
		+ Collection library.
	- *Java* does not allow such formation/composition of new functions.
+ Immutable variables \cite[\S5.1, pp. 137]{Tate2010}
	- Requires explicit indication of whether a variable is mutable.
	- Concurrency can have unforeseen/unpredictable (/uncertain) effects
		on mutable variables.
		+ These effects may seem erratic.
	- *Java* requires a (rarely used) modifier for variables to be
		immutable.
	- A mutable variable is a variable that can hold multiple values
		after its initialization.
		Any variable that is not mutable is an immutable variable
		\cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}.
+ Advanced programming constructs \cite[\S5.1, pp. 137]{Tate2010}
	- Actors for concurrency.
	- *Ruby*-style collections with higher-order functions.
	- XML processing.
+ Lightweight programming language \cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}









#	Notes on Functional Programming

Characteristics of a functional programming language
	\cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}:
+ Compose functional programs with functions.
+ "A function always returns a value."
+ For a given set of inputs, a function will return a given set of outputs.
	When this is done repeatedly, the set of outputs is the same as that
		of other repetitions.
+ In the functional programming paradigm, software developers avoid
	changing the state of an executing program or modifying its data. 
	- The use of assignments to modify the values of variables is discouraged
		[Wikipedia contributors, 2016].
	- The values of variables can be modified via recursive function calls
		[Wikipedia contributors, 2016].




"*Scala* is not a pure functional programming language,"
	since it allows values of variables to be modified
	\cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010}.

##	Pure Functional Programming Languages

"Pure functional programming languages allow" software developers to
	use a programming style that has certain mathematical features
	or characteristics
	\cite[\S5.1, pp. 138]{Tate2010} [Wikipedia contributors, 2016].
