#	Lua



##	Characteristics of *Lua*

+ Tables in *Lua* provide "a single, unifying abstraction" that is used to build
	"object systems, custom data structures," ...
	This supports clean implementations that are platform-independent, the
		plug and play paradigm, and facilitates software extension and
		maintenance \cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. ix]{Tate2014}.
+ Fast, flexible programming/scripting language
	\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
+ Embeddable prototype language for production systems
	\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
+ Flexible inputs and outputs of functions \cite[\S1, pp. 1]{Tate2014}.
+ "Rich syntax and proper semantics" \cite[\S1, pp. 1]{Tate2014}.
+ "Quick, portable little [scripting] language" \cite[\S1, pp. 1]{Tate2014}.
+ Expressive language \cite[\S1, pp. 3]{Tate2014}.
	+ Tables \cite[\S1, pp. 3]{Tate2014}.

#	Factor

##	Characteristics of *Factor*

+ "Concatenative programming model" in "a full-featured, practical environment"
	\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. x]{Tate2014}.
+ Concatenative, stack-based programming model
	\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
+ Full-featured library\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
+ UI framework \cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
+ Web framework \cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.





##	Notes about *Factor*

+ Composition of functions \cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xv]{Tate2014}



##	Advantages of *Factor*

##	Disadvantages of *Factor*



#	Elm

Reference the following points (Reference these!!!)
+ functional reactive programming (FRP)
+ concurrency
+ GUI programming/development
+ Web development


##	Characteristics of *Elm*

+ Supports reactive programming, by using data flows and functions to propagate
	change \cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.
	- Remove callbacks to simplify *JavaScript* applications, by "representing
		user interactions as signals that map onto functions"
			\cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}.

#	Elixir

##	Characteristics of *Elixir*

+ "Pure functional [programming] language"
	\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xvii]{Tate2014}:
	- Runs "on the *Erlang* virtual machine"
	- Has "a rich *Ruby*-like syntax"
	- *Lisp*-style macros






##	Notes about *Elixir*

+ Macros:
	- Express code in templates, via metaprogramming
		\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xv]{Tate2014}





##	Advantages of *Elixir*

##	Disadvantages of *Elixir*






#	Julia

##	Characteristics of *Julia*

+ For computing regarding statistics and multi-dimensional mathematics
	\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xviii]{Tate2014}
+ Designed for concurrent and parallel computing
	\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xviii]{Tate2014}

#	miniKanren

##	Characteristics of *miniKanren*

+ A domain-specific language (DSL), rather than a programming language, for
	logic programming \cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xviii]{Tate2014}.
+ Embedded logic DSL in general purpose programming language enables
	miniKanren developers to use logic programming in real world scenarios
		\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xviii]{Tate2014}.













##	Notes about *miniKanren*

+ Express rules, rather than express individual steps of a procedure
	\cite[\SIntroduction, pp. xv]{Tate2014}





##	Advantages of *miniKanren*

##	Disadvantages of *miniKanren*










#	Idris

##	Characteristics of *Idris*

+ Has dependent types \cite[\SAcknowledgments, pp. xviii]{Tate2014}







##	Notes about *Idris*


##	Advantages of *Idris*

##	Disadvantages of *Idris*




#	Miscellaneous Information

+ comma-separated values (CSV) \cite[\S1, pp. 2]{Tate2014}
	- Makes it harder to modify entries in CSV, without the "support [for]
		collections and constraints"
