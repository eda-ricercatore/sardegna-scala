 * Test suite for boilerplate-code.
 *
 * Main function for test suite:
 * This test suite will test the various packages/modules, and
 *	classes (and their functions) of boilerplate-code.
 *
 * For each class, the testing sequence would be:
 * # constructors
 * # accessor functions
 * # mutator functions
 * # destructor
 *
 * The current testing sequence of classes is:
 * # utilities
 *		@ violated_assertion
 *		@ violated_postcondition
 *		@ violated_precondition
 *		@ printer
 * ...
 * # node
 *
 *
